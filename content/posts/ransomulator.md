[Ransomulator](https://github.com/zeronetworks/BloodHound-Tools/tree/main/Ransomulator) is a tool for [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound).

BloodHound is an open source tool that uses the power of graph databases to help attackers and defenders determine how their Active Directory environments could be compromised. Traditionally used by red teams, itâ€™s a tool that blue teams should leverage extensively.

As BloodHound gathers information on computers, accounts, sessions and much more, it is an ideal tool to generate a simulated ransomware infection, quickly allowing you to understand how fast a compromised system could lead to all systems being compromised. [Ransomulator](https://github.com/zeronetworks/BloodHound-Tools/tree/main/Ransomulator) helps you do that more easily.

I've previously made [training for BloodHound](pluralsight.pxf.io/XkjDo)[^1: Affiliate Link], available on Pluralsight.
